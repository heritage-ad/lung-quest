# Lung Quest
A decision-based game exploring the clinical trial journey for lung cancer patients.

## Concept
Lung Quest is an educational, decision-based game that simulates the clinical trial process for lung cancer patients. Players step into the role of a fictional patient and answer a series of eligibility questions based on age, smoking history, diagnosis, and lifestyle factors.

Based on their answers, players are either:
- Guided through treatment trial options (aggressive or palliative), or
- Shown why they may not qualify â€” all within an interactive, user-friendly format.

This project aims to increase awareness of clinical trial access and decision-making through gamified healthcare storytelling. Designed for accessibility and clarity, *Lung Quest* empowers users to understand the trial journey in a simple and engaging way.
