Lung Quest is an educational, decision based game that stimulates the clinical trial process for lung cancer patients. Players step into the shoes of a fictional patient and answer a series of eligibilty questions based on age, smoking history, diagnosis, and lifestyle factors. Based on their answers, they are either guided to explore different treatment options or shown why they may not qualify, all in an interactive user-friendly way.


This project aims to increase awareness of clinical trial access and decision making through gamified healthcare storytelling. Designed for accessibility and clarity, Lung Quest empowers users to understand the trial journey in a simple and engaging format.
